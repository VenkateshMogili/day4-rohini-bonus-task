=>The design looks very good 👏
=>All the paddings, margins and colors looks good 🤩


Suggestions:

App.jsx: Excellent code 👏

ColorCards.jsx:
1.Create a separate variable for array instead of inline array (line 7)
2.toLowerCase() is not required in (line 9), the items in the array should be small without using extra method.
3.Inline style is not recommended (line 11)
4.carttitles[index] is not required (line 15), should combine both cardtitles and colors into array of objects.
5.cardtitles name should be camelcase (line 4), cardTitles

BarChartimg.jsx:
6.BarChartimg name should be pascal case (line 1), can be BarChartImg
7.image prop is not suitable (line 2), can use src prop as it's relevant name.

App.css:
8.display:float is not recommended (line 22), can use flex properties.

9.images can store in assets folder as it's created for the same purpose.
10.image file name should be divided with hyphen (Ex: days-chart-bar.png,lines-chart.png)

App.css: Excellent code 👏
-> All spaces given properly.

Score: 3000
